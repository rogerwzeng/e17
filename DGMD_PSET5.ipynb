    "There are various versions and nuances on the Canny Edge Detection algorithm, so we'll provide some more, explicit details on the mechanics of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the steps of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Reduce the noise using a Gaussian Kernel / Convolution (pre-filter on the image)\n",
    "2.   Compute the image gradients (use a gradient approximation operator / kernel / filter)\n",
    "3.   Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) which filters out noise around the edges / keeps the maxima points\n",
    "4.   Apply 2-stage thresholding to remove disconnected weak edges and connect strong edges with adjacent weak edges (hysteresis)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Noise Reduction with the Gaussian Kernel\n",
    "The gaussian kernel is defined by this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "G_\\sigma = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}e^{-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\sigma$ parameter is the strength of the Gaussian blur. Additionally, the Gaussian kernel is defined by its size $n$ which dictate it's dimension (the bigger the size, the stronger the Gaussian kernel will be). The value of $n$ is an odd number and indicates that the Gaussian kernel will be size $n \\times n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have our Gaussian kernel, we convolve it with the image. To perserve the original dimensions of the image, we should use padding at the boundaries / edges. To avoid our Canny Edge Detection algorithm from picking up false edges at the boundaries of the image, we will extend the image by using pixels at the image boundary, meaning that the extra pixels we pad to the image will take the value of the pixels from the nearest boundary. For pixels padded to the corner, it will take the value of the nearest corner pixel. By padding our image in this fashion, we avoid creating false spikes in our image pixel data (e.g., consider how zero padding might lead to false edges at the boundary of the image).\n",
    "\n",
    "For your implementation, $\\sigma$ and $n$ will be two parameters (there will be called `s` and `n` in the function signatures, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Compute the Image Gradients\n",
    "We need gradients of the image to see where edges are because edges are where pixel values rapidly change value (so their rate of change is high). Unfortunately, we can't mathematically define exact gradients for discrete values such as pixel values. However, we can approximate them. For images, this can be done by using filters / operators such as Sobel, Prewitt, and/or Roberts. These filters / operators define kernels to calculate gradients in the $x$ and $y$ directions - with this information, the true gradient magnitude and direction can be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that there are different variants of these filters, such as different sizes (e.g., $3 \\times 3$ Sobel vs $5 \\times 5$ Sobel, etc.). For your implementation, you'll work with these variants of the operators.\n",

Similar to the Gaussian kernel from step 1, we convolve $G_x$ and $G_y$ with the image. To perserve the original dimensions of the image, we should use padding at the boundaries / edges. We are left with $I_x$ which is the image gradient along the X direction and $I_y$ which is the image gradient along the Y direction. To find the true gradient magnitude and direction, we can use basic trignometry and arrive at:\n",

    "\n",
    "The first equation is for the magnitude of the gradient and the second equation is for the angle that the gradient is pointing in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your implementation, `gradient_kernel` will be a parameter. It will be a string flag that will equal `sobel`, `prewitt`, or `roberts` indicating which gradient approximation kernel should be used (i.e., if `gradient_kernel = sobel`, use the sobel operator defined above for gradient calculations).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for Image Gradients\n",
    "Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is a crucial step where we filter away all the noisy gradient values and find the places where the gradients truly represent edges. At a high level, NMS looks along the direction that each pixel's gradient points to, and sees if the point has the maximal gradient value along that direction amongst its neighbors (i.e., nearby pixels). If it is maximal, it stays, otherwise it is suppressed (i.e., zero-ed out).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the gradient points to a neighboring pixel, such as at a $45°$ or $90°$ angle which represents pointing to it's north-east pixel neighbor and it's east pixel neighbor, respectively, it's very clear to which gradient values should be compared. For example, if the gradient points at a $45°$ angle, we would compare the gradient values along that direction, meaning we'd compare gradient values with the north-east pixel and south-west pixel, as those neigboring pixels are along the direction of the gradient. However, when the gradient points in a direction that is between pixels, such as $85°$, then we don't have a direct pixel neighbor to compare with - to resolve this we will either approximate, which means we use the nearest pixel neighbor in that direction, or interpolate what the gradient value would be in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation, we'll stick with approximating with the nearest neighbor in the direction of the gradient. From the earlier step, we stated that the angle of the gradient can be determined by the $\\text{atan2}$ function. This function returns values between $[-180°, 180°]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the implementation easier, we can exploit the symmetry with angles. We can relate a negative gradient angle with a positive gradient angle. For example, if the gradient angle was $-135°$, it is along the same axis as a gradient with angle $45°$. Thus, to convert our negative gradients to their corresponding positive gradient, we add $180°$. Thus, our new domain after this transformation is $[0°, 180°]$. Note: although this transformation flips the direction for gradients with negative angles, it doesn't really affect the Canny Edge Detection algorithm because the algorithm compares gradient values along the direction axis (so it compares both the positive and negative direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the above transformation, we'll take those angle values and round it to a value so that the gradient points in a direction of neighboring pixel:\n",
    "- Gradient angles in $[0°, 22.5°)$ or $[157.5°, 180°]$ will map to $0°$ meaning the gradient points along the east and west direction; thus the gradient value of the pixel should be compared with its east and west neighbor; if it's greater than it's east and west neighbor, it stays, otherwise it's suppressed and it's gradient value goes to zero.\n",
    "- Gradient angles in $[22.5°, 67.5°)$ will map to $45°$ meaning the gradient points along the north-east and south-west direction; thus the gradient value of the pixel should be compared with its north-east and south-west neighbor; if it's greater than it's north-east and south-west neighbor, it stays, otherwise it's suppressed and it's gradient value goes to zero.\n",
    "- Gradient angles in $[67.5°, 112.5°)$ will map to $90°$ meaning the gradient points along the north and south direction; thus the gradient value of the pixel should be compared with its north and south neighbor; if it's greater than it's north and south neighbor, it stays, otherwise it's suppressed and it's gradient value goes to zero.\n",
    "- Gradient angles in $[112.5°, 157.5°)$ will map to $135°$ meaning the gradient points along the north-west and south-east direction; thus the gradient value of the pixel should be compared with its north-west and south-east neighbor; if it's greater than it's north-west and south-east neighbor, it stays, otherwise it's suppressed and it's gradient value goes to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in this implementation, when we think about a pixel's neighbors, we are look at the $3 \\times 3$ window about the pixel (where the pixel is in the center). However, we can also implement this by looking at a bigger window of neighbors such as a $5\\times5$ window. For this implementation. we'll only stick with the $3 \\times 3$ window.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, a bunch of gradients will go to zero and we'll be left with only gradients that were maximal (in their $3 \\times 3$ neighborhood of pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Two-Stage Hysteresis\n",
    "The remaining gradients will still be noisy. To handle that noise, we'll apply two stage hysteresis / filtering. We'll define a `high_threshold` and `low_threshold` where `high_threshold` > `low_threshold`. If a pixel value's gradient is above `high_threshold`, it's a strong edge and is kept. If a pixel value's gradient is less than the `low_threshold`, then it's suppressed (goes to zero). If a pixel value's is between the `low_threshold` and `high_threshold` inclusive, then it's considered a weak edge. A weak edge will only remain if one of it's adjacent neigbors (for this implementation, it is the $3 \\times 3$ window centered on the pixel) is marked as a strong edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the actual gradient values are arbitary (in the sense that the range of gradient values will be different for different images and gradient approximation kernel), we'll standardize them at this point so that the `high_threshold` and `low_threshold` have a standard range for any image or gradient approximation kernel. Scale the gradient value such that all the gradient values are now numbers between 0 to 1 (where the smallest gradient value mapped to 0 and the largest gradient value mapped to 1). This can be acheived by taking each gradient value, subtracting the smallest gradient value and then dividing by the difference between largest and smallest gradient value (this effectively shifts the gradient range to start at zero and scales it to be between 0 and 1). With this, the `high_threshold` and `low_threshold` parameters will be float numbers between `0` and `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel values that correspond to an edge will stay and everything else will go to zero. In the end, we'll be left with a binary map of which pixels correspond to edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your implementation, `high_threshold` and `low_threshold` will be parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results and Other Notes\n",
    "The return value should be a matrix that is the original dimension as the input image `img`. Furthermore, the matrix should be matrix of `0` and `1` where `0` represents no edge and `1` represents an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "- Be wary of edges / corners - you'll need to have special logic / exceptions to handle them\n",
    "- Pay attention to the shape of the matrices and units (i.e., degrees vs radians)\n",
    "- For numeric stability, a common pre-processing step in computer vision is to normalize our images, such that values fall between 0 and 1. Since pixel values can take on values between 0 to 255 inclusive, a simple way to normalize images is to rescale the pixel values by a factor of $\\frac{1}{255}$"

    "`two_stage_hysteresis` (10 pts). The input into this function will be the gradient magnitude matrix, after applying non-maximal suppression (`NMS`) and being scaled (`rescale_matrix`) (i.e., assume those steps have already been done so no need to do them inside the function). The values in the input matrix, `M`, will take values between 0 to 1 inclusive. Given a `high_threshold` and `low_threshold` where `high_threshold` > `low_threshold`, perform two-stage hysteresis on the matrix `M`. The `high_threshold` and `low_threshold` parameters will be float numbers between `0` and `1`. The output should a binary matrix the same shape as `M` where `0` represents no edge and `1` represents an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, the algorithm for two-stage hysyeresis is:\n",
    "- If a pixel value's gradient is above `high_threshold`, it's a strong edge and is kept (goes to one in the final binary image matrix).\n",
    "- If a pixel value's gradient is less than the `low_threshold`, then it's suppressed (goes to zero in the final binary image matrix).\n",
    "- If a pixel value's is between the `low_threshold` and `high_threshold` inclusive, then it's considered a weak edge. A weak edge will only remain if one of it's adjacent neigbors (for this implementation, it is the $3 \\times 3$ window centered on the pixel) is marked as a strong edge (goes to one in the final binary image matrix). Otherwise, it's suppressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: for handling the gradients at the border, where gradient values need to be compared with gradient values that fall outside the image boundary, you can assume that the gradient values outside the gradient matrix are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the pixel values that correspond to an edge will stay and everything else will go to zero. In the end, we'll be left with a binary map of which pixels correspond to edges.\n"
