        "In this section, let's model the robot's terrain as a coordinate plane. At time $t=0$, the robot is at position $(0,0)$ facing forward in the right / positive `x`-direction (more precisely, has absolute orientation of 0 radians). Based on this initial starting point and orientation, determine the absolute position of the robot at each time step from time $t=1$ to time $t=5$. Note: the numbers for this section might be more \"messy\" because trig functions are getting involved.\n",
